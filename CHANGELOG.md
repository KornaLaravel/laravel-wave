#### üéõÔ∏è Take a full control.

Migrated from the [legacy `EventSource`](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2177#issuecomment-267270198) to state-of-the-art  [@microsoft/fetch-event-source](https://github.com/Azure/fetch-event-source) based on [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) üí™.

### What's new

- **Support for Custom Authentication Headers**: As of [Echo 1.14.0](https://github.com/laravel/echo/releases/tag/v1.14.0), you can personalize your auth headers. Thanks to @ezequidias for the inspiration in https://github.com/qruto/laravel-wave/discussions/20
- 
- **Debug Mode**: Idea from https://github.com/qruto/laravel-wave-js/discussions/14
- 
- **[`retry`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#retry) Field Support**: We've added support for the `retry` field for setup reconnection time after connection close.
- 
- **Intelligent Connection Management with `pauseInactive`:** This feature taps into the [Page Visibility API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API) to close connections when the document is hidden (like when a user minimizes the window), and auto-retries with the last event ID when it becomes visible again. This optimizes your server load.
- 
- **Custom CSRF Token Support**: Craft your CSRF tokens as you see fit.
- 
- **Full Customizability for Request Options**: You now have the power to tailor any [Request option](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/Request#options) to your needs.

#### Fixed

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Our `.error(...)` callbacks are now fully operational.
- **Persistent Leave Presence Channel Request**: With the new `keepalive` option, your leave presence channel requests will be sent even if a user closes their browser.
