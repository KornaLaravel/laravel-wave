# Introduction

Unlock the power of Laravel's [broadcasting system](https://laravel.com/docs/master/broadcasting)
with **Wave**. Imagine that real-time server broadcasting is possible over native HTTP without any WebSockets setup.

Meet the [**Server-sent Events**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) üóº Works seamlessly with Laravel's default `redis` broadcasting driver and supports [Laravel Echo](https://github.com/laravel/echo).

> Server-Sent Events (**SSE**) is specially tuned for real-time server-to-client communication.

Experience it live with our [demo streaming tweets](https://wave.qruto.dev) üê§.

Works well at home. Should be battle tested for **1.0**, feedbacks appreciated!

## üåü Key Features

- **‚ö° Native Redis Driver Support**: Wave seamlessly integrates with Laravel's default `redis` broadcasting driver, ensuring efficient real-time data transfer.

- **üîÑ Resume From Last**: Connection drops? No problem! Wave intelligently resumes the event stream from the last event, ensuring no crucial data is lost in transit.

- **üü¢ Live Models**: With a simple interface that respects Laravel's native conventions for [Model Events Broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/master/broadcasting#model-broadcasting)
  and [Broadcast Notifications](https://laravel.com/docs/master/notifications#broadcast-notifications), Wave turbocharges your application with real-time updates.

- **üéõÔ∏èÔ∏è Full Requests Control**: Wave hands you the reins over connection and authentication requests, granting you the freedom to shape your broadcasting setup to your exact requirements.

## Support

I have spent a lot of effort playing with SSE, Laravel broadcasting system and Redis to prepare **Laravel Wave** and make it available for everyone. Since of February 24, unfortunately I haven't any commercial work, permanent living place or the ability to plan anything for the long term. However, I have a greater desire to continue creating useful solutions for people around the world. It makes me feel better these days.

## Installation

Install **Wave** on both server and client sides using Composer and npm:

```bash
composer require qruto/laravel-wave
npm install laravel-wave
```

Then, set your `.env` file to use the `redis` broadcasting driver:

```ini
BROADCAST_DRIVER=redis
```

## Usage

After installing **Wave**, your server is ready to broadcast events.
You can use it with **Echo** as usual or try `Wave` model to work with predefined Eloquent events.

### 1. With Laravel Echo

Import Laravel Echo with `WaveConnector` and pass it to the broadcaster option:

```javascript
import Echo from 'laravel-echo';

import { WaveConnector } from 'laravel-wave';

window.Echo = new Echo({ broadcaster: WaveConnector });
```

For fresh installations, locate Echo connection configuration in **resources/js/bootstrap.js** file.

Replace it by the snippet above:
<details>
    <summary>Show diff</summary>

```diff
- import Echo from 'laravel-echo';

- import Pusher from 'pusher-js';
- window.Pusher = Pusher;

- window.Echo = new Echo({
-     broadcaster: 'pusher',
-     key: import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_APP_KEY,
-     wsHost: import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_HOST ?? `ws-${import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER}.pusher.com`,
-     wsPort: import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_PORT ?? 80,
-     wssPort: import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_PORT ?? 443,
-     forceTLS: (import.meta.env.VITE_PUSHER_SCHEME ?? 'https') === 'https',
-     enabledTransports: ['ws', 'wss'],
- });
+ import Echo from 'laravel-echo';

+ import { WaveConnector } from 'laravel-wave';

+ window.Echo = new Echo({ broadcaster: WaveConnector });
```

</details>

Use Echo as you typically would.

### 2. With Live Eloquent Models

With native conventions of [Model Events Broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/master/broadcasting#model-broadcasting)
and [Broadcast Notifications](https://laravel.com/docs/master/notifications#broadcast-notifications) you can use
**Wave** models to receive model events and notifications.

```javascript
import Wave from 'laravel-wave';

window.Wave = new Wave();

wave.model('User', '1')
    .notification('team.invite', (notification) => {
        console.log(notification);
    })
    .updated((user) => console.log('user updated', user))
    .deleted((user) => console.log('user deleted', user))
    .trashed((user) => console.log('user trashed', user))
    .restored((user) => console.log('user restored', user))
    .updated('Team', (team) => console.log('team updated', team));
```

Start by calling the `model` method on the `Wave` instance with the model name and key.

By default, Wave prefixes model names with `App.Models` namespace. You can customize this with the `namespace` option:

```javascript
window.Wave = new Wave({ namespace: 'App.Path.Models' });
```

    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Define how long (in seconds) you wish an event stream to persist so it

    | information, please refer to the Mozilla developer's guide on event
    | stream format.

];
```

## Advanced Setup

### Persistent Connection

Depending on your web server configuration, you might observe that the connection drops at certain intervals.
Wave is designed to automatically reconnect after a request timeout.
During reconnection, you won't lose any events as Laravel Wave
stores event history for one minute by default.
The `resume_lifetime` value in the config file
allows you to adjust this duration.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure that the interval between events is shorter than your web server's request timeout 
> and that no other low-level timeout options are set to keep the connection persistent

Wave tries to send a ping event on each Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection request
if the last event occurred earlier than the `ping.frequency` config value.

If your application doesn't expect many SSE connections,
specify the list of environments in which a ping event will be sent
with each Wave request. By default, this is set to `local`.

### Manual Ping Control

For more control over the ping event, disable automatic sending by adjusting the `ping.enable` config value.

**Wave** offers the `sse:ping` command for manually sending a single ping or operating at an interval.

Use the Laravel [Tasks scheduler](https://laravel.com/docs/master/scheduling#introduction) to send a ping event every minute:

```php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    $schedule->command('sse:ping')->everyMinute();
}
```

If you require shorter intervals between ping events, use the --interval option to set the number of seconds:

```bash
php artisan sse:ping --interval=30
```

For example, basic `fastcgi_read_timeout` value is `60s` for Nginx + PHP FastCGI server setup.
This means that to keep the connection persistent, events must occur more often than every **60 seconds**.

### Web Server Configuration

Web servers usually don't expect persistent HTTP connections and may have limitations at various stages üòü.

For a Nginx + PHP FPM setup, the connection is typically limited to `1m` by [FastCGI](https://www.php.net/manual/install.fpm.php).
Modify the location directive after the end of `location ~ \.php$` as follows:

```nginx
location = /wave {
    rewrite ^/wave$ /index.php?$query_string break;
    fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
    fastcgi_index index.php;
    include fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_read_timeout 2m;
}
```

**Note:** Copy the `fastcgi_pass` Unix socket path from `location ~ \.php$`.

### Disabling PHP FPM Timeout

Some platforms, such as [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com), configure the PHP FPM pool with `request_terminate_timeout = 60`, terminating all requests after 60 seconds.

You can disable this in the `/etc/php/8.1/fpm/pool.d/www.conf` config file:

```ini
request_terminate_timeout = 0
```

Alternatively, you can configure a separate pool for the SSE connection:
